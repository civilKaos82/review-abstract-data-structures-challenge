# Review Abstract Data Structures

##Learning Competencies

##Summary

You have now worked extensively with the Array and Hash data structures, and learned a bit about Stack, Queue and Linked List. For this exercise you will delve deeper into another data structure of your choice.

Choose an **Abstract Data Structure** from
the list at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures) (**not** Stack or Queue or Linked List), and do the following:

### Describe

Describe the major functions of the data structure in your own words in 3 or 4 sentences.

### Implement

Implement the data structure and its primary functionality using either an array or hash.

Write test code to show how your implementation works. (Similar to what you saw in the Stack exercise).

### Get real

Describe a 'real' programming problem that you would model with your data structure and how the model represents the problem situation without exposing unneccesary data or methods.
